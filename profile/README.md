# AppKu&trade;
*AppKu* is a application development framework that allows developers to focus on their creativity and the purpose of what they are building by providing a suite of holistic, yet standalone, packages that make the nitty-gritty of application building nearly robotic.

Specifically, *AppKu* provides tooling to easily manage &amp; serve:

- Full-stack communication (front-end to back-end to storage). <small>*via @appku/stashku; "Stash" Ku, 区*</small>
- Serving up API enpoints and providing out-of-the-box HTTP middleware. <small>*via @appku/mizu; Mizu, 水*</small>
- Managing authentication and authorization. <small>*via @appku/nankinjo; Nankinjō, 南京錠*</small>
- Utility functions that are cross-environmentally supported: browser &amp; Node.JS. <small>*via @appku/shea; Shea, シェア*</small>
- File & directory reading/writing with TOML/YAML/JSON/raw data. <small>*via @appku/fairu; Fairu, ファイル*</small>
- Rendering of HTML templates to PDF. <small>*via @appku/origami; Origami, 折り紙*</small>
- Deployments. <small>*via @appku/shuriken; Shuriken, 手裏剣*</small>

This framework as a whole is still in the early stages of development, however, the following suites &amp; packages are ready for production-use. 

Development is continuing on these pacakges, but they are ready to be leveraged in your applications with key features.
