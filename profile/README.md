# AppKu&trade;
*AppKu* is a application development framework that allows developers to focus on their creativity and purpose by providing a suite of holistic, yet standalone, packages that help reduce the burden of implementing features commonly found in enterprise, full-stack, applications.

Specifically, *AppKu* provides tooling to easily manage &amp; serve:

- Full-stack communication (front-end to back-end to storage). <small>*via [@appku/stashku](https://github.com/appku/stashku); "Stash" Ku, 区*</small>
- Serving up API enpoints and providing out-of-the-box HTTP middleware. <small>*via [@appku/*-mizu](https://github.com/orgs/appku/repositories?q=mizu); Mizu, 水*</small>
- Managing authentication and authorization. <small>*via @appku/nankinjo; Nankinjō, 南京錠*</small>
- Utility functions that are cross-environmentally supported: browser &amp; Node.JS. <small>*via [@appku/shea](https://github.com/appku/shea); Shea, シェア*</small>
- File & directory reading/writing with TOML/YAML/JSON/raw data. <small>*via [@appku/fairu](https://github.com/appku/fairu); Fairu, ファイル*</small>
- Rendering of HTML templates to PDF. <small>*via [@appku/origami](https://github.com/appku/origami); Origami, 折り紙*</small>
- Deployments. <small>*via @appku/shuriken; Shuriken, 手裏剣*</small>

This framework as a whole is still in the early stages of development, however, the following suites &amp; packages are ready for production-use. 

Development is continuing on these pacakges, but they are ready to be leveraged in your applications with key features.

## Development Goals
1) Maximize cross-environmental support for browser &amp; Node.JS.
2) Minimize external package dependency as much as possible.
3) Unit test everything. 100% coverage on all @appku packages.
4) Follow the K.I.S.S. principal.
5) Prefer method chaining for key functionality.
6) Don't interfere with other frameworks (React, Vue, etc.), support them by being as vanilla-js as possible.
